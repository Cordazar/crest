# Crest

[Crest](http://github.com/cordazar/crest) is a REST API Server for MongoDB built in node.js.

## Archived

I finally got around to archiving this project since I have neither the time nor the use for it. If someone wants to fork and build on it, be my guest.

## About

The idea for crest was born when we needed a REST API for a MongoDB project at work and the ones we found were not what we expected from 

So this is my attempt at building a small and easy to use REST API Server for MongoDB with primary focus on json. Since this is my first time building a REST API I'll appreciate any and all feedback.

Crest stands for [Cygnus](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Cygnus) REST.


## Installation

### Recommended way
    npm install crest -g

This will install crest globally so that it may be run from the command line.

### As node.js module
    npm install crest

This will install crest as a module to be used as a part of some other project.

### Clone with git
    git clone git://github.com/Cordazar/crest.git


## Usage
If installed globally you can just run

    crest


### Quick try
After starting the server you can quickly try it out by issuing the following from the command line:

    curl -d '{ "Key" : 42 }' -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://localhost:3500/test/example

This should add a document to the collection **example** in database **test** looking similar to this: 

    { "Key": 42, "_id": ObjectId("4e90e196b0c7f4687000000e") }

### Supported REST requests
    GET /db/collection
Returns all documents (query and options can be sent in GET body)

    GET /db/collection?query=%7B%22isDone%22%3A%20false%7D
Returns all documents satisfying query

    GET /db/collection?query=%7B%22isDone%22%3A%20false%7D&limit=2&skip=2
Ability to add options to query (limit, skip, etc)
    
    GET /db/collection/id
Returns document with _id_
    
    POST /db/collection
Insert new document in collection (document in POST body)
    
    PUT /db/collection/id
Update document with _id_ (updated document in PUT body)
    
    DELETE /db/collection/id
Delete document with _id_

### Content Type
Please make sure `application/json` is used as Content-Type when using POST/PUT/GET with data in request body.


## Setup

### Configuration parameters

By default, these parameters are saved in __config.json__. An alternate path may be specified via a command line argument `--configPath=some/path/config.json`.

Database settings where username and password are optional.

    db [object]
        host [string]
        port [string]
        username [string] (optional)
        password [string] (optional)

Server settings for where and how the rest api is going to be run.

    server [object]
        port [string] 
        address [string]

General settings

    flavor [string] (mongodb or normal)
    debug [boolean]

#### Flavors
* Choose **mongodb** as flavor to keep using *\_id* as primary key for a document.
* Choose **normal** as flavor if you want to change *\_id* to *id*

### Dependencies
Application dependencies are sorted under dependencies in _package.json_ while test dependencies are sorted under devDependencies. 


## Tests
Basic tests are available and can be run via [mocha](http://visionmedia.github.com/mocha/). 

These tests require a working mongodb installation and might require changes to __config.json__

Recommended way to run mocha in terminal with mocha reporter _spec_ chosen.

    mocha -R spec
    
More indepth tests will be added at a later date.
